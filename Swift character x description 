Computer-based terminals communicating with SWIFT use EBCDIC code. When an "x" is indicated in the format of a field, the character set is as follows:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

0123456789

/-?:().,'+

 CrLf Space

The characters Cr and Lf must never be used as single characters and must only be used together in the sequence CrLf, that is, LfCr is not allowed.

When the character sequence CrLf is used in a field format with several lines, it is used to indicate the end of one line of text and the start of the next line of text. 206469
