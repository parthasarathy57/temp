In the Trade Express application, the "Transaction Work Desk" includes a "STAGE" column grid. The `TxnWorkDesk` repository context fetches the `CodeDecodeList` from the React component. The state description is retrieved via a CodeDecode API call, stored in session storage (under TRANSACTION WORKFLOW STAGE en) within Trade Express, matched with the stage code, and used to set the "Stage" and "Stage Description" fields.
