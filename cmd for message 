In the local setup, the `package-lock.json` shows the `cauiuse-list` module as missing (see the picture below).

In the `release1.3.0` branch, I pulled a fresh copy of the code without any changes, installed the node modules using the same `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. However, when running `npm run build`, an error occurs (see the error below).

Despite this, `npm run start` works fine. I also tried using npm version 20.
