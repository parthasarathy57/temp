I have completed the Insurance and Banking courses as part of the mandatory curriculum. However, in the Banking course, the "Payment Beginner Course FS Messaging and Messaging Infrastructure" is still showing as 'In Progress,' even though I have completed it multiple times since August 1, 2024. I have taken a screenshot of this issue and sent it to Shelke Vaishnavi, but I have not received a proper response. What should I do next?
