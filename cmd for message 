In our Swift project, we have three patterns: X, Y, and Z. Each time we use Swift free text, we call the desired pattern. The highlighting color change for the textarea is not working in the tx-web-component despite all modifications. To address this, I wrote code in the tx-framework-components to dynamically pass through the pattern.
