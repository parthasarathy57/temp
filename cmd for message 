Subject: Field Responsiveness Issue in 1450+ Width

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue we are experiencing with field responsiveness. Specifically, two fields are not responsive when the width exceeds 1450 pixels. Below this width, they function correctly.

Could you please investigate and address this matter?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
