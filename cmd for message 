Subject: Assistance Needed with Course Status Issue

Dear [Recipient’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding an issue with my course progress. I have completed all the courses except for the one on insurance related to FS messaging and messaging service. Despite having finished this course multiple times since August 1, it still appears as “in progress” in my account.

Could you please assist me in resolving this issue?

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
