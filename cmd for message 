I spoke with Clement and Emmanuel, and they confirmed that the highlighted text is completed. They want all the functionality code, including tippyjs and the overflow tooltip, moved to the `tx-web-component`. Once they confirm, the PR will be accepted.

Tomorrow, I'm taking off. What should I do with the ticket? I have three tickets: one is completed, and two are pending because of the PR.
