Hereâ€™s a refined version of your message:

"I recently received a mail regarding a swipe issue, and it mentions a 10-day period. Out of those, I took 2 days of privileged leave. Unfortunately, I missed seeing the mail earlier. I kindly request an exception for this instance, assuring that this will not happen again. I have also attached an image showing the permission granted for my leave."
