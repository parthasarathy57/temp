In the Trade Express application, the "Transaction Work Desk" features a "Stage" column grid. The `TxnWorkDesk` repository context retrieves the `CodeDecodeList` from the React component. The state description is obtained from a CodeDecode API call, stored in session storage, matched with the stage code, and then applied to set the "Stage" and "Stage Description" fields.
