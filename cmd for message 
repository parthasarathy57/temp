Here's a rephrased version of your message:

I have made the necessary changes for the above ticket in the `tx-framework-components` and `tx-react-components` repositories. The tickets are completed, but I have some doubts in three places. Specifically, when trying to get a prop as `string[]`, it doesn't seem to retrieve the values correctly.

Could we connect for a code review and to address these issues?
